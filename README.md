# Spatial Analysis in R

## Introduction
This repository is intended to hold my analysis for my response to Ari Lamstein's 
R Shapefile [contest](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2016/07/12/announcing-r-shapefile-contest/). 

## Analysis Question
My Analysis consists of my efforts to answer the following questions:

  1. What is the effect of distance to the nearest airport on a county's unemployment rate?
  
  2. How does the traffic of the nearest airport affect unemployment rates?. This is measured on the airport's passenger emplanements and cargo movements.
